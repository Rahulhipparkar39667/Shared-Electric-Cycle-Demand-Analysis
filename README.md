# About Project

This project explores the factors influencing the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market, focusing on Yuluâ€™s revenue challenges. Using a dataset of bike rentals, I conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applied statistical methods to derive actionable insights. Univariate and bivariate analyses helped highlight key patterns in bike rentals.

I utilized hypothesis testing to examine the impact of various factors on rental demand. A t-test was performed to analyze the effect of "working day" on rental count, revealing that while 68.6% of cycles were rented on working days compared to 31.4% on non-working days, the difference wasn't statistically significant. An ANOVA test was conducted to assess seasonal influences, and the results indicated a significant difference in the mean number of rentals across seasons, confirming seasonality's impact on demand.

Through this analysis, the project aims to offer insights that can guide business decisions, optimizing the availability of shared cycles and addressing Yulu's demand issues.
